    <h1>Privacy Policy for Socials & Entertainment Blocker</h1>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy outlines how Socials & Entertainment Blocker ("we",
      "our", "us") collects, uses, and protects the information obtained from
      users ("you") when using our Chrome extension. Our primary purpose is to
      help users focus by blocking distracting websites, and we are committed to
      protecting your privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      We only collect the minimum amount of information needed to provide the
      functionality of the extension. Specifically, we use the
      <code>webNavigation</code> API to monitor and block access to specific
      websites. No web history or personally identifiable information is stored
      or shared. All processing happens locally within your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The information collected via the <code>webNavigation</code> API is only
      used to prevent access to distracting websites in real-time. This data is
      not stored, transmitted, or shared with any third parties. It is used
      solely to enhance your productivity and focus by blocking certain
      websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties. The
      data used by this extension remains strictly within your local browser
      environment.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You can uninstall or disable the extension at any time via the Chrome
      browser's settings. Once uninstalled, the extension will no longer have
      any access to your browser or browsing behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritize security and do not store any data outside your browser. The
      extension operates locally and does not transmit data over the internet.
      Your browsing habits and any data collected remain private and secure
      within your local environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to the Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on the extensionâ€™s page, and we encourage you to review the policy
      periodically. Your continued use of the extension constitutes your
      acceptance of any changes made to this policy.
    </p>
